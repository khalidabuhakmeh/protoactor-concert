# Proto.Actor Concert Registration

Implemented a simple actor model, where child actors are responsible for tracking tickets at a concert. This allows you to register for the concert without over purchasing.

I'm just starting to learn how to create an actor model, so I would love feedback.

## Getting Started

- .NET SDK
- [proto.actor](https://proto.actor)

Should just be able to `dotnet run` the main project, which is a console application.
